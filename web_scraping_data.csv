content,"Hi gang,
I’m fed up with Click Funnels and custom creating all my funnels on Webflow.
So far I’ve run into one issue which I have figured out a solution.
When I would duplicate my template page and make changes for the client version it would make changes on the template too (same classes)
I found someone in this forum who had a solution, duplicating each class and re-naming it.
This fixed my problem, and now I’m trying to think ahead of what other problems I could encounter.
So far I’ve thought of remembering to change form names… Can anyone else think of issues I may see, so that I can hopefully avoid them 
Thanks,
Jacob"
